wake is automatically building Makefile to build your source code.
- analyze the dependency
- create a makefile

# constraints
- it is recommend that the OS follow POSIX

# what not supported yet
- some options (-L for a library)
- create a file with arbitrary (.c .cc or .hpp) file identifier

you can handle these problems by fixing the created makefile, or I'm welcome to your contribute for some extentions.
